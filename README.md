# LTSA
Labelled Transition System Analyser

<br>

A verification tool for concurrent systems is referred to as LTSA. It performs an automated check to ensure that the specification of a concurrent system fulfills the requirements placed on its behavior's properties. In addition to this, LTSA provides specification animation, which makes it easier to do interactive research into how a system behaves.

The Labelled Transition System Analyser (LTSA) plugin's Message Sequence Chart (MSC) feature enables graphically altering collections of scenarios to create message sequence charts, which can then be used to visually explain models. As part of an iterative design process, the LTSA may be used to find implied possibilities in the system.

<br>

This is an extended version of the LTSA verification tool with a working MSC plugin.
